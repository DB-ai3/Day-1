# Day-1
First step in the world of robotis and robotics club of IOE Purwanchal Campus.First of all I would like to thank robotics club for providing me opportunity of this technomorph training. As today was my first day I basically know about how robots work, it's usage in differnet field and it's importance in daily life. Before this session,I used to  think only sophiya, chiti (Robot movie), etc as a robot. But today, I realized that robots are much more diverse. They are not limites to human shaped machine they also includes drone, robotic arms, military robots,service robots,etc.  I also learned the importace of documentation, especially for robotics and other research projects.I got introduced to tools like LateX, which will be useful for writing research paper in the future.I also got a chance to be familier with platdfrom like git, github where we can documnet our project and share it with the world. After the completion of todays training I created my github accound and started documenting my training experience in it.I also installed aurdino IDE in my device which would help me in the remaining days of training as we dive deeper into hands-on projects. I'm really excited and hopeful for more interesting and challenging experiences in the remaining days of trianing.
